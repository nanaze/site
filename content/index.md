## About this site

This is a personal website like folks used to have in the halcyon days
of the web. It is primarily intended as a landing page from web search
results, social media bios, etc. It includes a longer biography as
well as a home for longer-form writings.

I am in the process of building this site out to replace my [old
university site](http://cs.wisc.edu/~naze/) now that I've been out of
school for, oh, decades.

## Writings

In time, I hope to include a chronological list of things I've written
here. For now, it's a short list.
