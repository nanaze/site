## About this site

This is a personal website like folks used to have in the halcyon days
of the web. It is primarily intended as a landing page from web search
results, social media bios, etc. It includes a longer biography as
well as a home for longer-form writings.

I am in the process of building this site out to replace my [old
university site](http://cs.wisc.edu/~naze/) now that I've been out of
school for, oh, decades.

## About me

I live in an old house in Berkeley, California with my wife (an environmental
lawyer), two young children, and a Roomba. I grew up in Wisconsin, went to
school in Madison, and have lived in the Bay Area and New York City.

Since 2005 I've been employeed at Google as a software engineer and technical
lead. In recent years, I've been working on frontend infrastructure for Google
Search. Previously, I've worked on the Google Android app, Closure Library,
Google Books, and other projects.

## Writings

In time, I hope to include a chronological list of things I've written
here. For now, it's a short list.
