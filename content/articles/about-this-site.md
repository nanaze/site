I used to write in small personal blogs. Early on, especially when
blogging was novel, I'd run custom scripts to run these sites &#8212;
my career path was shaped early on from the autodidactic experience of
putting those sites together (on top of a more traditional CS
education). Such experience led to a string of college jobs, which led
to a job and a move to Silicon Valley, many years ago.

I'd eventually stopped "rolling my own" and just settled for a Blogger
account, not having to worry about serving, maintenance, etcetera, but,
as Blogger aged, my interest in writing waned, and I missed the
simplicity and the flexibility.

For years, I'd been meaning to set up something simple just to serve
stable, long-lived pages with stable URLs for when I wanted to publish
something longer than tweet length. GitHub offers a [decent-enough
solution](https://pages.github.com) for serving such static content,
and so I set up a [small repository](https://github.com/nanaze/site)
that simply generates the static files and pushes them to my GitHub
Pages repo, visible here.
